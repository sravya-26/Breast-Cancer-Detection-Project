📖 Overview
Early and accurate detection of breast cancer significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project utilizes supervised machine learning models to classify tumors based on features extracted from digitized fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

🗂️ Dataset
Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)
Includes diagnostic features such as:

Radius

Texture

Perimeter

Area

Smoothness

And more...

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

🏗️ Model Architecture
Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms:
